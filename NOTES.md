 - This app's logout was working, but mine was not working because of error "Missing parameters: id_token_hint". Error disappears if I use the ["Blazor Web App with OpenID Connect (OIDC)" sample fron dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/blazor-samples/tree/main/8.0/BlazorWebAppOidc)

### On the value of integration tests

> "In my experience, writing "integration" tests in ASP.NET Core are for controllers is far more valuable than trying to unit test them, and is easier than ever in ASP.NET Core"
> --- [Andrew Lock](https://andrewlock.net/should-you-unit-test-controllers-in-aspnetcore/)

> "Writing integration (or functional) tests on a C# API gives more confidence in the code that is written, in addition, it increases the productivity during all stages of development."
> --- [Tim Deschryver](https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/why-writing-integration-tests-on-a-csharp-api-is-a-productivity-booster) 

> "In my opinion, one good integration test is worth 1,000 unit tests."
> ---  [Khalid Abuhakmeh](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/secrets-of-a-dotnet-professional#integration-tests--unit-tests)

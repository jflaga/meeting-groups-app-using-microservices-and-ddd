# Meeting Groups app using Microservices and DDD

An imitation of ["Modular Monolith with DDD"](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd) and ["Evolutionary Architecture by Example: Chapter 4"](https://github.com/evolutionary-architecture/evolutionary-architecture-by-example): An app for Meeting Groups domain, using Microservices, and Tactical DDD on core subdomain.

Domain is described here: https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd?tab=readme-ov-file#2-domain

Plan: Create a microservice for the `Meetings` subdomain (the core subdomain). The other subdomains will be placed in a modular monolith. Use Keycloak as IDP.
